# Iris Data Preprocessing

This project demonstrates a full preprocessing pipeline using the Iris dataset, including data cleaning, imputation, encoding, feature scaling, and visualization. The goal is to prepare the data for machine learning tasks and gain hands-on experience with real-world data handling.

## Dataset

The Iris dataset is a classic dataset included in scikit-learn, containing measurements for three types of Iris flowers.

## Steps Covered

1. Load and explore the dataset
2. Simulate and handle missing values using mean imputation
3. Encode the target label using LabelEncoder
4. Feature engineering: created 'sepal area'
5. Remove outliers using the IQR method
6. Normalize features using StandardScaler
7. Visualize data using boxplots and heatmaps
8. Save the preprocessed dataset

## Libraries Used

- pandas  
- numpy  
- matplotlib  
- seaborn  
- scikit-learn

## How to Use

1. Open the `iris_data_preprocessing.ipynb` notebook
2. Run all cells to view preprocessing steps and visualizations
3. The preprocessed dataset will be saved as `iris_preprocessed.csv`
